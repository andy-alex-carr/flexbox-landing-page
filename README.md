# flexbox-landing-page
This is my first Web developing project using HTML and CSS code. It's a web page whose content is arranged vertically and designed for a vertical viewport with a width of more or less than 1440 px. Its main feature is the positioning of elements and sections of the page by means of the CSS Flexbox Layout Model.
